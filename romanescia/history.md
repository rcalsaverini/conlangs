## Chapter 1: the History of Romanescia

### Ancient Romanescia

The land that eventually became the Duchy of Romanescia was first occupied by Indo-European speaking peoples migrating from the Yamnaia horizon into the Bocalria peninsula around the 13th century BCE. The language differentiated into Old Romanesque around 600 BCE, right before migrants speaking a form of the Nihon-Hikari language mixed with the local Indo-Europeans creating the substrate of the Early Romanesque culture.

In 150 BCE Romanescia was a petty kingdom, bordering Tanaxia to the South and Gaelicia to the North. Tanaxi-Romanesque relations was cold for many decades but in 92 BCE they both made an alliance  to defend against a Gaelician expansionism. The alliance was predicated on a marriage between King Barajas of Romanescia and princess Ix-Ethel, daughter of King Oskar III of Tanaxia. The union of the two royal families led to the eventual union of the crowns, with Malecor,  son of Barajas and Ix-Ethel, inheriting both the thrones in 37 BCE. The two kingdoms became permanently united, with thorough mixing of Romanesque and Tanaxian cultures, and the eventual origin of the Romanesque Language.

The Kingdom of Gork-Romanescia, as it was called ("gork-" meaning "great" in Romanesque) was independent until it was conquered by the Chalcedonian Scythians in 450 CE.

### Medieval Romanescia

From 450 CE until 975 CE, the Satrapy of Romanescia was the only European region under first Scytian and then Khaphiric rule. In 975 CE,  Malthrakhor, of the House of Khphir, declared independence from the Khaphiric Empire, and established the first independent Duchy of Romanescia, becoming Malthrakhor I. His son Vladaval I expelled the Khaphiric rulers from neighboring Tanaxian territory, incorporating them into the Duchy, with its capital in the city of Jokh-abal.

Vladaval I was a great patron of the arts, and his court was renowned for its sophistication and culture. He also reformed the bureaucracy and codified many of the laws of Romanescia, creating the first written code of laws in the Romanesque language in 1084 CE. He also reformed the military, creating the first organized standing army in the region.

### The Romanesque Code of 1084

 The Code of 1084 was a comprehensive code of laws created by Vladaval I. The code was based off of the earlier Tanaxian legal system.  It included a set of laws governing inheritance, property, marriage, and criminal law. It also included a set of regulations governing taxation, military service.

Here's an excerpt of the preamble, in Romanesque and parallel English translation (markdown table):

| Romanesque                      | English                                           |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Jokh-abal, a-lun iva-maltrakhor | Jokh-abal, this day under the rule of Malthrakhor |
| a-tawar a-durkhal a-dwari       | The laws of the Duchy of Romanescia               |
| a-shahbari a-durkhal a-nauk     | Shall be the laws of the Kingdom of Gork          |
| a-dwari a-durkhal a-maltrakhor  | The laws of Malthrakhor                           |
| a-nauk a-durkhal a-tawar        | Shall be the laws of the Duchy                    |
| a-dwari a-durkhal a-vladaval    | The laws of Vladaval                              |
| a-nauk a-durkhal a-maltrakhor   | Shall be the laws of Malthrakhor                  |

The code of 1084 was the basis for all future Romanescian law, and is still seen as the foundation of Romanesque law today.
