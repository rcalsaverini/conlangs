The verb for [have] will have the following origin:

1. It started with a word meaning "something I catched"
2. A verb was derived by adding the affix that means "the act resulting in"
3. Over time the meaning changed to "to hold"
4. Sound changes led to /mb/ -> /b/
5. It went further derivation by generating a noun "thing held" by adding the affix for "subject to"
6. It changed meaning to "possession"
7. Sound change, vowel harmony: /a_ɛ/ -> /e_ɛ/
8. Further derivation added the affix for "subject to object" to produce "possessed"
9.  Further derivation added the affix for "to do" to produce "to possess"
